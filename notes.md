- merge current drafts of the paper and make more of a skeleton [Peter]

- to describe the method we will write out the simple WF simulation from tests/ and say that sequential simplify is important but just bookkeeping [Peter]

- benchmark time spent in msprime versus in simulation [kevin]

- investigate the effect of the simplify interval [kevin]

- write out the simplify algorithm [Jerome]

- make a plot of simulation timing, with log N on the x axis, and time per generation on the y, in each case doing a single chromosome with selected mutation rate low enough that we get on order of tens of selected mutations.
    * figure out parameter values and tell Jaime [Kevin]
    * run this also in SimuPOP [Jaime]
