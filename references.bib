  abstract = {In this article we discuss the ancestry of sequences sampled from the coalescent with recombination with constant population size 2N. We have studied a number of variables based on simulations of sample histories, and some analytical results are derived. Consider the leftmost nucleotide in the sequences. We show that the number of nucleotides sharing a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with the leftmost nucleotide is approximately log(1 + 4N Lr)/4Nr when two sequences are compared, where L denotes sequence length in nucleotides, and r the recombination rate between any two neighboring nucleotides per generation. For larger samples, the number of nucleotides sharing MRCA with the leftmost nucleotide decreases and becomes almost independent of 4N Lr. Further, we show that a segment of the sequences sharing a MRCA consists in mean of 3/8Nr nucleotides, when two sequences are compared, and that this decreases toward 1/4Nr nucleotides when the whole population is sampled. A measure of the correlation between the genealogies of two nucleotides on two sequences is introduced. We show analytically that even when the nucleotides are separated by a large genetic distance, but share MRCA, the genealogies will show only little correlation. This is surprising, because the time until the two nucleotides shared MRCA is reciprocal to the genetic distance. Using simulations, the mean time until all positions in the sample have found a MRCA increases logarithmically with increasing sequence length and is considerably lower than a theoretically predicted upper bound. On the basis of simulations, it turns out that important properties of the coalescent with recombinations of the whole population are reflected in the properties of a sample of low size.},

  abstract = {If homologous sequences in a population are not subject to recombination, they can all be traced back to one ancestral sequence. However, the rest of our genome is subject to recombination and will be spread out on a series of individuals. The distribution of ancestral material to an extant chromosome is here investigated by the coalescent with recombination, and the results are discussed relative to humans. In an ancestral population of actual size 1.3 million a minority of <6.4% will carry material ancestral to any present human. The estimated actual population size can be even higher, 5 million, reducing the percentage to 1.7%.},

@article{marjoram2006coalescent,
  abstract = {The amount of genome-wide molecular data is increasing rapidly, as is interest in developing methods appropriate for such data. There is a consequent increasing need for methods that are able to efficiently simulate such data. In this paper we implement the sequentially Markovian coalescent algorithm described by McVean and Cardin and present a further modification to that algorithm which slightly improves the closeness of the approximation to the full coalescent model. The algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree.We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions, such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data, in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing coalescent algorithms.This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent models.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a model of a gene as a continuous length of DNA represented by the interval [0,1].  The ancestry of a sample of genes is complicated by possible recombination events, where a gene can have two parent genes.
  An analogue of Kingman's coalescent process, in which the ancestry of a sample of genes at a single locus is described by a stochastic binary tree, is a stochastic ancestral recombination graph, with vertices wehre coalescent or recombination events occur.  All the information about  ancestry is contaned in this graph.
 The sample DNA lengths have marginal ancestral trees at each point in [0,1] which are imbedded in the graph.  An upper bound is found for the number of distinct most recent common ancestors of these trees, and the expected minimum waiting time to these ancestors.},

@article{wilton2015smc,
  abstract = {Two sequentially Markov coalescent models (SMC and SMC') are available as tractable approximations to the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). We present a Markov process describing coalescence at two fixed points along a pair of sequences evolving under the SMC'. Using our Markov process, we derive a number of new quantities related to the pairwise SMC', thereby analytically quantifying for the first time the similarity between the SMC' and the ARG. We use our process to show that the joint distribution of pairwise coalescence times at recombination sites under the SMC' is the same as it is marginally under the ARG, which demonstrates that the SMC' is, in a particular well-defined, intuitive sense, the most appropriate first-order sequentially Markov approximation to the ARG. Finally, we use these results to show that population size estimates under the pairwise SMC are asymptotically biased, while under the pairwise SMC' they are approximately asymptotically unbiased.},
