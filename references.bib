                 structure and result in a correlation between genetic and
                 geographic distance, commonly called isolation-by-distance.
                 Despite the prevalence of isolation-by-distance in nature, to
                 date few studies have empirically demonstrated the processes
                 that generate this pattern, largely because few populations
                 have direct measures of individual dispersal and pedigree
                 information. Intensive, long-term demographic studies and
                 exhaustive genomic surveys in the Florida Scrub-Jay
                 (Aphelocoma coerulescens) provide an excellent opportunity to
                 investigate the influence of dispersal on genetic structure.
                 Here, we used a panel of genome-wide SNPs and extensive
                 pedigree information to explore the role of limited dispersal
                 in shaping patterns of isolation-by-distance in both sexes,
                 and at an exceedingly fine spatial scale (within ~10 km).
                 Isolation-by-distance patterns were stronger in male-male and
                 male-female comparisons than in female-female comparisons,
                 consistent with observed differences in dispersal propensity
                 between the sexes. Using the pedigree, we demonstrated how
                 various genealogical relationships contribute to fine-scale
                 isolation-by-distance. Simulations using field-observed
                 distributions of male and female natal dispersal distances
                 showed good agreement with the distribution of geographic
                 distances between breeding individuals of different pedigree
                 relationship classes. Furthermore, we built coalescent
                 simulations parameterized by the observed dispersal curve,
                 population density, and immigration rate, and showed how
                 incorporating these extensions to Mal{\'e}cot's theory of
                 isolation-by-distance allows us to accurately reconstruct
                 observed sex-specific isolation-by-distance patterns in
                 autosomal and Z-linked SNPs. Therefore, patterns of fine-scale
                 isolation-by-distance in the Florida Scrub-Jay can be well
                 understood as a result of limited dispersal over contemporary
                 timescales.",

                 has been interpreted as support for the simple model of
                 genetic hitchhiking, in which directional selection on rare
                 variants, e.g., newly arising advantageous mutants, sweeps
                 linked neutral alleles to fixation, thus eliminating
                 polymorphisms near the selected site. However, the frequency
                 spectra of segregating sites of several loci from some
                 populations exhibiting reduced levels of nucleotide diversity
                 and reduced numbers of segregating sites did not appear
                 different from what would be expected under a neutral
                 equilibrium model. Specifically, a skew toward an excess of
                 rare sites was not observed in these samples, as measured by
                 Tajima's D. Because this skew was predicted by a simple
                 hitchhiking model, yet it had never been expressed
                 quantitatively and compared directly to DNA polymorphism data,
                 this paper investigates the hitchhiking effect on the site
                 frequency spectrum, as measured by Tajima's D and several
                 other statistics, using a computer simulation model based on
                 the coalescent process and recurrent hitchhiking events. The
                 results presented here demonstrate that under the simple
                 hitchhiking model (1) the expected value of Tajima's D is
                 large and negative (indicating a skew toward rare variants),
                 (2) that Tajima's test has reasonable power to detect a skew
                 in the frequency spectrum for parameters comparable to those
                 from actual data sets, and (3) that the Tajima's Ds observed
                 in several data sets are very unlikely to have been the result
                 of simple hitchhiking. Consequently, the simple hitchhiking
                 model is not a sufficient explanation for the DNA polymorphism
                 at those loci exhibiting a decreased number of segregating
                 sites yet not exhibiting a skew in the frequency spectrum.",

                 risk is unknown. Theoretical models that relate population
                 genetic processes to the maintenance of genetic variation for
                 quantitative traits may suggest profitable avenues for future
                 experimental design. Here we use forward simulation to model a
                 genomic region evolving under a balance between recurrent
                 deleterious mutation and Gaussian stabilizing selection. We
                 consider multiple genetic and demographic models, and several
                 different methods for identifying genomic regions harboring
                 variants associated with complex disease risk. We demonstrate
                 that the model of gene action, relating genotype to phenotype,
                 has a qualitative effect on several relevant aspects of the
                 population genetic architecture of a complex trait. In
                 particular, the genetic model impacts genetic variance
                 component partitioning across the allele frequency spectrum
                 and the power of statistical tests. Models with partial
                 recessivity closely match the minor allele frequency

                 association studies without requiring homozygous effect sizes
                 to be small. We highlight a particular gene-based model of

  abstract = {In this article we discuss the ancestry of sequences sampled from the coalescent with recombination with constant population size 2N. We have studied a number of variables based on simulations of sample histories, and some analytical results are derived. Consider the leftmost nucleotide in the sequences. We show that the number of nucleotides sharing a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with the leftmost nucleotide is approximately log(1 + 4N Lr)/4Nr when two sequences are compared, where L denotes sequence length in nucleotides, and r the recombination rate between any two neighboring nucleotides per generation. For larger samples, the number of nucleotides sharing MRCA with the leftmost nucleotide decreases and becomes almost independent of 4N Lr. Further, we show that a segment of the sequences sharing a MRCA consists in mean of 3/8Nr nucleotides, when two sequences are compared, and that this decreases toward 1/4Nr nucleotides when the whole population is sampled. A measure of the correlation between the genealogies of two nucleotides on two sequences is introduced. We show analytically that even when the nucleotides are separated by a large genetic distance, but share MRCA, the genealogies will show only little correlation. This is surprising, because the time until the two nucleotides shared MRCA is reciprocal to the genetic distance. Using simulations, the mean time until all positions in the sample have found a MRCA increases logarithmically with increasing sequence length and is considerably lower than a theoretically predicted upper bound. On the basis of simulations, it turns out that important properties of the coalescent with recombinations of the whole population are reflected in the properties of a sample of low size.},

The algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree.We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions, such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data, in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing coalescent algorithms.This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent models.},

Using our Markov process, we derive a number of new quantities related to the pairwise SMC', thereby analytically quantifying for the first time the similarity between the SMC' and the ARG. We use our process to show that the joint distribution of pairwise coalescence times at recombination sites under the SMC' is the same as it is marginally under the ARG, which demonstrates that the SMC' is, in a particular well-defined, intuitive sense, the most appropriate first-order sequentially Markov approximation to the ARG. Finally, we use these results to show that population size estimates under the pairwise SMC are asymptotically biased, while under the pairwise SMC' they are approximately asymptotically unbiased.},

@article{wilkins2004separation,
  abstract = {This article presents an analysis of a model of isolation by distance in a continuous, two-dimensional habitat. An approximate expression is derived for the distribution of coalescence times for a pair of sequences sampled from specific locations in a rectangular habitat. Results are qualitatively similar to previous analyses of isolation by distance, but account explicitly for the location of samples relative to the habitat boundaries. A separation-of-timescales approach takes advantage of the fact that the sampling locations affect only the recent coalescent behavior. When the population size is larger than the number of generations required for a lineage to cross the habitat range, the long-term genealogical process is reasonably well described by Kingman's coalescent with time rescaled by the effective population size. This long-term effective population size is affected by the local dispersal behavior as well as the geometry of the habitat. When the population size is smaller than the time required to cross the habitat, deep branches in the genealogy are longer than would be expected under the standard neutral coalescent, similar to the pattern expected for a panmictic population whose population size was larger in the past.

The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Malécot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, σe; the effective population density, ρe; and a local scale, κ, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.

  abstract = {Approximately 2–4\% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred
with anatomically modern humans. Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic
regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles.
However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that
Neanderthals had at least 40\% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal
introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-
Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5\%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on
mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the
Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious
alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other
species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.},

  abstract = {Forward Wright–Fisher simulations are powerful in their ability to model complex demography and selection scenarios, but suffer from slow execution on the Central Processor Unit (CPU), thus limiting their usefulness. However, the single-locus Wright–Fisher forward algorithm is exceedingly parallelizable, with many steps that are so-called “embarrassingly parallel,” consisting of a vast number of individual computations that are all independent of each other and thus capable of being performed concurrently. The rise of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and programming languages designed to leverage the inherent parallel nature of these processors have allowed researchers to dramatically speed up many programs that have such high arithmetic intensity and intrinsic concurrency. The presented GPU Optimized Wright–Fisher simulation, or “GO Fish” for short, can be used to simulate arbitrary selection and demographic scenarios while running over 250-fold faster than its serial counterpart on the CPU. Even modest GPU hardware can achieve an impressive speedup of over two orders of magnitude. With simulations so accelerated, one can not only do quick parametric bootstrapping of previously estimated parameters, but also use simulated results to calculate the likelihoods and summary statistics of demographic and selection models against real polymorphism data, all without restricting the demographic and selection scenarios that can be modeled or requiring approximations to the single-locus forward algorithm for efficiency. Further, as many of the parallel programming techniques used in this simulation can be applied to other computationally intensive algorithms important in population genetics, GO Fish serves as an exciting template for future research into accelerating computation in evolution. GO Fish is part of the Parallel PopGen Package available at: http://dl42.github.io/ParallelPopGen/.},

SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output, facilitating easy and fast model development with quick prototyping and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic simulation packages.},

We used simulations based on this algorithm to verify the accuracy of the ancestral recombination graph approximation by comparing it to the exact Wright–Fisher scenario. We find that the recombination graph is generally a very good approximation for models with complete outcrossing, whereas, for models with self-fertilization, the approximation becomes slightly inexact for some combinations of selfing and recombination parameters.},

The core of simuPOP is a scripting language (Python) that provides a large number of objects and functions to manipulate populations, and a mechanism to evolve populations forward in time. Using this R/Splus-like environment, users can create, manipulate and evolve populations interactively, or write a script and run it as a batch file. Owing to its flexible and extensible design, simuPOP can simulate large and complex evolutionary processes with ease. At a more user-friendly level, simuPOP provides an increasing number of built-in scripts that perform simulations ranging from implementation of basic population genetics models to generating datasets under complex evolutionary scenarios.simuPOP is freely available at http://simupop.sourceforge.net, distributed under GPL license.},

This package includes an enhanced graphical user interface program called Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility (BEAUti) that enables access to advanced models for molecular sequence and phenotypic trait evolution that were previously available to developers only. The package also provides new tools for visualizing and summarizing multispecies coalescent and phylogeographic analyses.
